This code accompanies my work on quantum bit (discrimination) that is available at [http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02311].

Consider the following problem: We want to discriminate two geometrical shapes, e.g., a square and a circle, that are drawn on a 2D space such as a sheet of paper. From within the paper, the two shapes cannot be distinguished as they will both appear as straight lines. To resolve this, we have to rise to the third dimension, outside of the paper, where the two shapes will then appear distinct. However, consider the case where the two shapes are a square and an isoceles rectangle. Rising to the third dimension will not be enough, as the two shapes may be once again indistinguishable due to coinciding perspectives. One has therefore to choose the vantage points in the three dimensions optimally so as to resolve the two projections.

The analogy of the geometrical shapes above is transposed to the quantum real where the shapes are quantum states. The goal remains the same however: The Bayesian network looks for the optimal vantage points in the higher dimensions from which the quantum states are maximally distinguished.

NOTE: This MATLAB code runs on clusters.
